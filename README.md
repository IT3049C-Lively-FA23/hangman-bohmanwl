## Self-Evaluation:

how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment:
15-18, Theoretically everything should work as Visual Studio Code isnt giving me any errors on sections I've completed. However the application wont run because of errors in the provided index.HTML. So technically my application dosnt "run with no errors", and i took a couple points extra off just in case there is another error I havent seen.

## Self-Reflection:
I appreciate the step by step comments to help walk me through the project. most of the time my issues with these projects is knowing exactly what i need to be implementing, however the comments really helped me understand exactly what i need to be doing at each section. One issue i did have was for some reason my index.HTML file keeps crashing. Visual Studio Code is saying all the sections ive completed can compile correctly, however I've got redmarks in the index.HTML even though I didnt touch it. These were there even after I had just cloned the repo to my desktop. Because of it I cant really test my game, as I dont want to mess with files I'm not supposed to.

### How long it took me to finish this?
4 hours
